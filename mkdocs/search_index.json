If you are about to open a Pull Request, please make sure to follow the [submissions guidelines][new-pr].\n\n\nContributing to the project\n\n\n\n\nFork the \nrsquarelabs/framework\n repository! \n\n\nClone the repository to your local machine. \n\n\nSelect an issue from \nrsquarelabs/framework\n to work on or \n\nsubmit a proposal\n of your own.\n\n\nCreate a feature or hotfix, or fix  branch depending on the type of issue.\n\n\nWrite the \ntests\n needed, take care of Python 2 \n 3 compatibility issues. \n\n\nModify existing or add new \n.md\n files to the docs directory.\n\n\nAs you work, build the documentation site locally to see your changes using \nmkdocs serve\n.\n\n\nCheck your writing for style and mechanical errors.\n\n\nSquash your commits on your branch.\n\n\nMake a pull request from your fork back to  \nmaster\n branch.\n\n\nWork with the reviewers until your change is approved and merged.\n\n\n\n\nSetting the Dev Env\n\n\nTo start developing on rsquarelabs/framework, clone the repo:\nFrom the root of the repository:\n\n\n# Clone the project\ngit clone git@github.com:rsquarelabs/framework.git\n\n# Create the virtual environment\nvirtualenv venv\n\n# Install requirements\nvenv/bin/pip install -r requirements/dev-requirements.txt\n\n# Activate the environment\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\n# Access the commands\npython sbin/r2_gromacs.py init # for gromacs module\npython sbin/r2_server_start # start the webclient in localhost\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n You do not need a database or to run migrate.\n\n\nAll the changes should broadly follow the \nPEP 8\n style conventions, \nand we recommend you set up your editor to automatically indicate non-conforming styles.\n\n\nTesting\n\n\n\n\nWrite tests for all the code that you write, which includes writing the unittests to integration tests. \n\n\nAlways try to test the compatibility with Python versions 2x and 3x.\n\n\n\n\nCompatibility Issues\n\n\nSometimes, in order to ensure your code works on various different versions of R2-Core framework, \nPython or third party libraries, you'll need to run slightly different code depending on the environment. \nAny code that branches in this way should be isolated into the \ncompat.py\n module, \nand should provide a single common interface that the rest of the codebase can use.\n\n\nWriting Documentation\n\n\nThe documentation for R2-Core framework is built from the \nMarkdown\n source files in the \n\ndocs\n directory.\n\n\nThere are many great Markdown editors that make working with the documentation really easy. Test the documentation by seeing \nyour changes using \nmkdocs serve\n. You should be able to access the documentation locally at \nhttp://localhost:8000\n\n\nSubmitting a Pull Request\n\n\nThe pull request (PR) process is in place so that we can ensure changes made to the \ncodes are the best changes possible. A good PR will do some or all of the following:\n\n\n\n\nExplain why the change is needed\n\n\nPoint out potential issues or questions\n\n\nAsk for help from experts in the company or the community\n\n\nEncourage feedback from core developers and others involved in creating the software being documented.\n\n\nCheck if the code is Python 2 \n 3 compatible. \n\n\n\n\nWriting a PR that is singular in focus and has clear objectives will encourage all of the above. \nDone correctly, the process allows reviewers (maintainers and community members) \nto validate the claims of the documentation and identify potential problems in communication or presentation\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, make sure to base your work on the \ndev\n branch (the development branch):   a bugfix branch for dev would be prefixed by \nfix/\n\n  # a bugfix branch for master would be prefixed by \nhotfix/\n\n\n\n\n$ git checkout -b feature/my-feature dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease create commits containing \nrelated changes\n. For example, two different bugfixes should produce two separate commits. A feature should be made of commits splitted by \nlogical chunks\n (no half-done changes). Use your best judgement as to how many commits your changes require.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite insightful and descriptive commit messages. Also add the issue number to make more sense for the issue.\n Please provide a summary in the first line (50-72 characters) along with the issue number \n#\nissue_number\n in the commit message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \ninclude the appropriate test cases\n for your patch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure all tests pass before submitting your changes. See the \nMakefile operations\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the linter does not throw any error: \nmake lint\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRebase your commits. It may be that new commits have been introduced on \ndev\n. Rebasing will update your branch with the most recent code and make your changes easier to review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ git fetch \n git rebase origin/dev\n\n\n\n\nPush your changes:\n\n\n\n\n$ git push origin -u feature/my-feature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a pull request against the \ndev\n branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we suggest changes:\n\n\n\n\nPlease make the required updates (after discussion if any)\n\n\n\n\nOnly create new commits if it makes sense. Generally, you will want to amend your latest commit or rebase your branch after the new changes:\n\n\n$ git rebase -i dev    # choose which commits to edit and perform the updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-run the test suite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForce push to your branch:\n\n\n$ git push origin feature/my-feature -f\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've made a pull request take a look at the \nTravis build status\n in the GitHub interface and make sure \nthe tests are running as you'd expect.\nGitHub's documentation for working on pull requests is \navailable here\n.\n\n\nSubmitting an issue\n\n\nBefore you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe you will find that a similar one already exists.\n\n\nIf you are submitting an issue for a bug, please include the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn overview of the issue\n\n\nYour use case (why is this a bug for you?)\n\n\nThe version of rsquarelabs-core you are running\n\n\nThe platform you are running rsquarelabs-core on\n\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue\n\n\nLogfiles if available are helpful.\n\n\nIdeally, a suggested fix\n\n\n\n\nGit Commit Guidelines\n\n\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the AngularJS change log.\n\n\nThe commit message formatting can be added using a typical git workflow or through the use of a CLI wizard (\nCommitizen\n). To use the wizard, run npm run commit in your terminal after staging your changes in git.\n\n\nEvery Commit must be one of the following Type :\n\n\n\n\nfeat\n: A new feature\n\n\nfix\n: A bug fix\n\n\ndocs\n: Documentation only changes\n\n\nstyle\n: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing\n  semi-colons, etc)\n\n\nrefactor\n: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n\n\nperf\n: A code change that improves performance\n\n\ntest\n: Adding missing tests\n\n\nchore\n: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation\n  generation\n\n\n\n\nCode of Conduct\n\n\nWe follow the code of conduct by \ncontributor-covenant.org\n\n\n\n\nWe are eager to see your contribution!\n\n\nWe collect all requests and ideas and share with the community for feedback, you should watch the milestones and issues for further roadmap updates.",

Each version will be \nmostly backwards compatible with the previous release. Exceptions to this \nrule will be listed in the release notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n is the patch release version number, which is incremented for \nbugfix and security releases. \nThese releases will be 100% backwards-compatible with the previous patch release. \nThe only exception is when a security or data loss issue can\u2019t be fixed without breaking \nbackwards-compatibility. If this happens, the release notes will provide detailed upgrade instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore a new feature release, we\u2019ll make alpha, beta, and release candidate releases. \nThese are of the form \nA.B alpha/beta/rc N\n, which means the \nNth alpha/beta/release\n candidate of version \nA.B\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn git, each release will have a tag indicating its version number, signed \nwith the release key. Additionally, each release series has its own branch, \ncalled \nstable/A.B.x\n, and bugfix/security releases will be issued from those branches.\n\n\nFeature release\n\n\nFeature releases (A.B, A.B+1, etc.) will happen roughly every eight months \u2013 see release process for details. These releases will contain new features, improvements to existing features, and such.\n\n\nPatch release\n\n\nPatch releases (A.B.C, A.B.C+1, etc.) will be issued as needed, to fix bugs and/or security issues.\n\n\nThese releases will be 100% compatible with the associated feature release, unless this is \nimpossible for security reasons or to prevent data loss. So the answer to \u201cshould I upgrade \nto the latest patch release?\u201d will always be \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\nLong-term support release\n\n\nCertain feature releases will be designated as long-term support (LTS) releases. These releases will get security and data loss fixes applied for a guaranteed period of time, typically three years.\n\n\n\n\nSupported versions\n\n\nAt any moment in time, developer team will support a set of releases to varying levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current development master will get new features and bug fixes requiring non-trivial refactoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatches applied to the master branch must also be applied to the last feature release branch, to be released in the next patch release of that feature series, when they fix critical problems:\n\n\n\n\nSecurity issues.\n\n\nData loss bugs.\n\n\nCrashing bugs.\n\n\nMajor functionality bugs in newly-introduced features.\n\n\nRegressions from older versions of rsquarelabs-core.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rule of thumb is that fixes will be backported to the last feature release \nfor bugs that would have prevented a release in the first place (release blockers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity fixes and data loss bugs will be applied to the current master, \nthe last two feature release branches, and any other supported long-term \nsupport release branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation fixes generally will be more freely backported to the last \nrelease branch. That\u2019s because it\u2019s highly advantageous to have the docs \nfor the last release be up-to-date and correct, and the risk of introducing \nregressions is much less of a concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a concrete example, consider a moment in time halfway between the release \nof rsquarelabs-core 5.1 and 5.2. At this point in time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures will be added to development master, to be released as rsquarelabs-core 5.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical bug fixes will be applied to the stable/5.1.x branch, and released as 5.1.1, 5.1.2, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity fixes and bug fixes for data loss issues will be applied to master and to the stable/5.1.x, stable/5.0.x, and stable/4.2.x (LTS) branches. They will trigger the release of 5.1.1, 5.0.5, 4.2.8, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation fixes will be applied to master, and, if easily backported, to the latest stable branch, 5.1.x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease cycle\n\n\nEach release cycle consists of three parts:\n\n\nPhase one: feature proposal\n\n\nThe first phase of the release process will include figuring out what major features to include in the next version. This should include a good deal of preliminary work on those features \u2013 working code trumps grand design.\n\n\nMajor features for an upcoming release will be added to the wiki roadmap page, e.g. https://github.com/rsquarelabs/rsquarelabs-core/wiki/ROADMAP.\n\n\nPhase two: development\n\n\nThe second part of the release schedule is the \u201cheads-down\u201d working period. Using the roadmap produced at the end of phase one, we\u2019ll all work very hard to get everything on it done.\n\n\nAt the end of phase two, any unfinished features will be postponed until the next release.\n\n\nPhase two will culminate with an alpha release. At this point, the stable/A.B.x branch will be forked from master.\n\n\nPhase three: bugfixes\n\n\nThe last third of a release cycle is spent fixing bugs \u2013 no new features will be accepted during this time. We\u2019ll try to release a beta release after one month and a release candidate after two months.\n\n\nThe release candidate marks the string freeze, and it happens at least two weeks before the final release. After this point, new translatable strings must not be added.\n\n\nDuring this phase, committers will be more and more conservative with backports, to avoid introducing regressions. After the release candidate, only release blockers and documentation fixes should be backported.\n\n\nIn parallel to this phase, \nmaster\n can receive new features, to be released in the \nA.B+1\n cycle.\n\n\n\n\nBug-fix releases\n\n\nAfter a major release (e.g. A.B), the previous release will go into bugfix mode.\n\n\nThe branch for the previous major release (e.g. \nstable/A.B-1.x\n) will include \nbugfixes. Critical bugs fixed on master must also be fixed on the bugfix branch; \nthis means that commits need to cleanly separate bug fixes from feature additions. \nThe developer who commits a fix to master will be responsible for also applying \nthe fix to the current bugfix branch.",

A.B  is the feature release version number. Each version will be \nmostly backwards compatible with the previous release. Exceptions to this \nrule will be listed in the release notes.    C  is the patch release version number, which is incremented for \nbugfix and security releases. \nThese releases will be 100% backwards-compatible with the previous patch release. \nThe only exception is when a security or data loss issue can\u2019t be fixed without breaking \nbackwards-compatibility. If this happens, the release notes will provide detailed upgrade instructions.    Before a new feature release, we\u2019ll make alpha, beta, and release candidate releases. \nThese are of the form  A.B alpha/beta/rc N , which means the  Nth alpha/beta/release  candidate of version  A.B .    In git, each release will have a tag indicating its version number, signed \nwith the release key. Additionally, each release series has its own branch, \ncalled  stable/A.B.x , and bugfix/security releases will be issued from those branches.",

The current development master will get new features and bug fixes requiring non-trivial refactoring.    Patches applied to the master branch must also be applied to the last feature release branch, to be released in the next patch release of that feature series, when they fix critical problems:   Security issues.  Data loss bugs.  Crashing bugs.  Major functionality bugs in newly-introduced features.  Regressions from older versions of rsquarelabs-core.     The rule of thumb is that fixes will be backported to the last feature release \nfor bugs that would have prevented a release in the first place (release blockers).    Security fixes and data loss bugs will be applied to the current master, \nthe last two feature release branches, and any other supported long-term \nsupport release branches.    Documentation fixes generally will be more freely backported to the last \nrelease branch. That\u2019s because it\u2019s highly advantageous to have the docs \nfor the last release be up-to-date and correct, and the risk of introducing \nregressions is much less of a concern.    As a concrete example, consider a moment in time halfway between the release \nof rsquarelabs-core 5.1 and 5.2.
