## Versioning

Minor version numbers (0.0.x) are used for changes that are API compatible. You should be able to upgrade between minor point releases without any other code changes.

Medium version numbers (0.x.0) may include API changes, in line with the deprecation policy. You should read the release notes carefully before upgrading between medium point releases.

Major version numbers (x.0.0) are reserved for substantial project milestones.
