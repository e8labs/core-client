#Editor Preferences


So this section tells you about setting up the development environment. 
Remember we only code the tools in **Python27**. 

## First things first 

1. Install Python27 via yum or apt-get or compile it yourself :)
2. We Prefer Linux, Mac or Unix based family as Operating System


Just wanted to remind **we code our tools only in Python-2.7 and on Unix/Linux flavored machines**

## Basic rules 

1. Set a Virtual Environment(virtualenv)
2. Change the default interpreter to your virtualenv



## PyCharm

I personally use [PyCharm] by Jetbrains, its the best editor for me :) and for most of the python developers :).
