#Setting up the Editors




## FrontEnd Development

### 1. Atom.io

I personally use atom editor for UI development. These are some packages I install in Atom to make to more powerful.

- [emmet-atom](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet-atom)
- [JSlint](https://atom.io/packages/jshint)
- [atom-bootstrap3](https://github.com/f/atom-bootstrap3)
- [angularjs](https://atom.io/packages/angularjs)
- [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview)
- [atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify)

## Backend Development

So this section tells you about setting up the development environment. Remember we only code our tools in **Python27**, because our tools are meant to run on only Unix/Linux flavored machines.

### First things first

1. Install Python27 via yum or apt-get or compile it yourself :)
2. We Prefer Linux, Mac or Unix based family as Operating System


> Code everything in and for Python-2.7

> Do the development in an isolated VIRTUALENV


### 1.PyCharm

I personally use [PyCharm] by Jetbrains, its the best editor for me :) and for most of the python developers :).



### 2.Eclipse - pydev

The classic editor, i taught myself coding in this editor, the best with lot of tools :)
